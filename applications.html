    <h1>What is the application of artificial intelligence?</h1>
   <ul style="font-size:120%;">

<h2 style="color: crimson;">Markting</h2>
       <ul style="list-style-type:disc; color:black; font-size: 20;"> 
           <p>
Marketing is a way to sugar coat your products to attract more customers. We, humans, are pretty good at sugar coating, but what if an algorithm or a bot is built solely for the purpose of marketing a brand or a company? It would do a pretty awesome job!
In the early 2000s, if we searched an online store to find a product without knowing it is exact name, it would become a nightmare to find the product. But now when we search for an item on any e-commerce store, we get all possible results related to the item. It is like these search engines read our minds! In a matter of seconds, we get a list of all relevant items. An example of this is finding the right movies on Netflix.

</ul>
<h2 style="color: crimson;">Banking</h2>
       <ul style="list-style-type:disc; color:black; font-size: 21;">
    <p>AI in banking is growing faster than you thought! A lot of banks have already adopted AI-based systems to provide customer support, detect anomalies and credit card frauds. An example of this is HDFC Bank.
HDFC Bank has developed an AI-based chatbot called EVA (Electronic Virtual Assistant), built by Bengaluru-based Senseforth AI Research. 
Since its launch, Eva has addressed over 3 million customer queries, interacted with over half a million unique users, and held over a million conversations. Eva can collect knowledge from thousands of sources and provide simple answers in less than 0.4 seconds.</p>
<h2 style="color: crimson;">Finance</h2>
 <p>Ventures have been relying on computers and data scientists to determine future patterns in the market. Trading mainly depends on the ability to predict the future accurately. 
Machines are great at this because they can crunch a huge amount of data in a short span. Machines can also learn to observe patterns in past data and predict how these patterns might repeat in the future.</p>
<h2 style="color: crimson;">Healthcare</h2>
    <p>When it comes to saving our lives, a lot of organizations and medical care centers are relying on AI. There are many examples of how AI in healthcare has helped patients all over the world.
An organization called Cambio Health Care developed a clinical decision support system for stroke prevention that can give the physician a warning when there’s a patient at risk of having a heart stroke.</p>
<h2 style="color: crimson;">Agriculture</h2>
    <p>Here’s an alarming fact, the world will need to produce 50 percent more food by 2050 because we’re literally eating up everything! The only way this can be possible is if we use our resources more carefully. With that being said, AI can help farmers get more from the land while using resources more sustainably.
Issues such as climate change, population growth, and food security concerns have pushed the industry into seeking more innovative approaches to improve crop yield.</p>
