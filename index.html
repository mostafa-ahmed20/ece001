    <h1>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h1>
    <p style="font-size:20;">In the simplest terms, <b>artificial intelligence (AI)</b> refers to systems or machines that mimic human intelligence to perform tasks and can iteratively improve themselves based on the information they collect.<br>
 <b>Artificial intelligence (AI)</b> makes it possible for machines to learn from experience ,Most AI examples that you hear about today from chess-playing computers to self-driving cars rely heavily on deep learning and natural language processing. Using these technologies, computers can be trained to accomplish specific tasks by processing large amounts of data and recognizing patterns in the data.<br>
<b>Artificial intelligence (AI)</b> is wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI is an interdisciplinary science with multiple approaches, but advancements in machine learning and deep learning are creating a paradigm shift in virtually every sector of the tech industry.

    <p style="font-size:20;">AI research follows two distinct, and to some extent competing, methods, the symbolic (or “top-down”) approach, and the connectionist (or “bottom-up”) approach. The top-down approach seeks to replicate intelligence by analyzing cognition independent of the biological structure of the brain, in terms of the processing of symbols—whence the symbolic label. The bottom-up approach, on the other hand, involves creating artificial neural networks in imitation of the brain’s structure—whence the connectionist label.</p>
